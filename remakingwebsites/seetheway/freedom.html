	<h1>The first step toward freedom</h1>
	<br>
	<p>There are two types of freedom that can be identified. Freedom from sin and freedom from God respectively. Libertarians fall into the trap of being free from "God" and rules of the universe and engaging in all manner of unnatural behavior or atleast promoting them, whereas believers or law-abiding-citizens are free from sin, but are bound to their God of Jesus or the Laws.</p>
	<p>Absolute freedom  is not an ideal state you should strive for. Being free from both morals and laws will not lead you to the place you want to get to. I started with becoming free from sin first. If you go down this path you will suffer overcoming your vices, but will have your eyes opened. If you take the other path, and wish to be free from the state or God first, you are deluding yourself, by thinking that you sinful and unnatural moral guidance will lead you to a better place when free from God.</p>
	<p>This essentially means that your goal first should be to remove "sin" from your life. I have studied Christianity superficially, but don't follow the religion. I will henceforth use sin to describe activities that will degrade your perception of life or your overall life quality in the long run, while providing a seemingly great advantage in the short term. I don't deny the possibility that God exists, however I still can't sense its presence in my life and I don't worship it. I also don't believe in an afterlife right now. It is a possibility, but I will not live this one with the knowledge of there being a second regardless. When you sin you are degrading your own life first and foremost. Of course it might seem like you get away with it, but in the end it will always come back to bite you. Therefore I must lead a life with as little sin as possible. </p>
	<p>The first step I would take upon knowing this is identifying how I am sinning against myself, and consequently, how to stop doing it. Sin becomes a habit as it is pleasureable in the moment. These are called addictions. As an addict you will have a hard time identifying if you are addicted, as you are blinded by it. You may ask your peers, and that might work depending on the person, or they might overlook something crucial. Realise that a lot of these activities are actively normalised by the people spreading them for their own benefits and the addicts themselves, not wanting to face the reality of it. The good news is once you have overcome one of these activities you will have an easier time spotting a second one alike. They all follow the pattern described above of short term satisfaction, long term loss. I will now give you a couple of starting points to work off of. </p>
  <p>Common addictions: alcohol, smoking and other drugs, gambling, sex and masturbation, technology in general (gaming, social media) etc. </p>
	<p>If you engage in any of these activities habitually you are an addict. This is but a small sample of all of the possible addictions, but it should give you and idea of what to look for if you are clueless. </p>
	<p>Once you will have quit an addiction you eyes will open up. This will then make your pursuit of the Way easier. You can't see the way if you are blinded by sin, so take action for you own sake. I may write a guide to quitting some of these addictions eventually. </p>
