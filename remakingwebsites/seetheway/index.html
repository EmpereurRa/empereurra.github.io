      <h3>About this site and the Way</h3>
      <p>The Way is an abstract expression I use over other ones like "the narrow path" or "the journey", it is the Way life is meant to be walked. In the modern world I find it very difficult to walk this Way, or rather difficult to break free of the chains holding me back, not letting me do so. I will talk about some of the bondages first here, then I will move on to other subjects.</p>
      <p>This site isn't a definitive guide for anyone to do anything, I am just putting my thoughts out into the ether. I find it easier to give good advice to myself when I'm trying to give advice to others, so even if all of my writings here won't reach anyone they will have done what I had intended them to do.  Definetely do not take this as advice or immediately take what I (or anyone for the matter) says as the truth. There are way too many people too open-minded, and there are also way too     many obstinate and unwilling to change. You need to determine if you are one of these types and make concious effort to fix that.</p>
