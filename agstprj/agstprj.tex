\aparagraph{I Object: \\
- The Object described by the other fields}
\aparagraph{II State of Matter notes: \\
We will use the following states of matter for this research: \\
   a) Solid: Closely packed particles  with strong inter-molecular forces leading to particles able to only vibrate but not move freely. A solid has a stable, definite shape and a definite volume \parencite{solids}; \\
   b) Liquid: A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure \parencite{liquids}; \\
   c) Gas: a compressible fluid. Not only will a gas conform to the shape of its container but it will also expand to fill the container \parencite{gases} ; \\
   d) Plasma: Ionized gaz with electrons \parencite{plasma}. }
\aparagraph{III Average Time to Live: \\
   - Average living time for an object, living time = time existing in a form that is not decomposed or altered beyond resemblence of the original object.}
\aparagraph{IV Climate notes: \\
1. for usage of x object at specific temperatures we will use the following notation: \\
   a) very cold = average temperature of place of usage under -10 degrees Celsius; \\
   b) cold = average temperature of place of usage from -10 degrees to 10 degrees Celsius; \\
   c) medium = average temperature of place of usage is from 10 degrees to 25 degrees Celsius; \\
   d) hot = average temperature of place of usage is from 25 degrees to 40 degrees. \\
2. for something used at least in temperatures from -20 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius we will use the notation "any".}
\aparagraph{V Object cost:  \\
   - Average cost of an object worldwide.}
\aparagraph{*notes: \\
 1. Fire is either considered a low-level plasma or a lightly ionized gas. \parencite{firedef}; \\
 2. Glass is a non-crystaline (it lacks long-range symmetry in it's system of particles, that which is characteristic of a crystal) solid that is sometimes considered to be a liquid due to its lack of a first-order phase transition where certain thermodynamic variables are discontinuous through the glass transition range. \parencite {glassdef} }
